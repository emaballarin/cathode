# Do not edit on drive  

If you have access to this repository, or the files contained in it, via Google Drive, Google Colab or another cloud-storage platform, it means that someone set up some kind of synchronization between the original repository and such platform.  

Since we accept pull requests only via GitHub, your situation may fall into the following:

- **You are the person responsible for the sync:** In such case, *the helm is yours*! Note, however, that a sync-back to git will be required if you want to contribute eventual edits back to the original repository.  

- **You just found the files synced:** Probably, if you edit such files, your changes will be overwritten by the next sync. In case of any doubt, ask the aforementioned *person responsible for the sync* any additional clarification.
